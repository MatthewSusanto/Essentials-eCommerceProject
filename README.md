## How to install and run the application?

You need to make sure that you have your package manager installed

1. **`cd essentials`** cd to the essentials directory
2. **`npm install`** once you are in essentials directory, install the dependencies
3. **`npm start`** start the application by using local a server (this is in development mode)

This might take a while to load up

## What did I learn?

- I am capable to solve problems that seem to be impossible if I stay positive, work hard, and keep trying with different solutions
- A better understanding of fetch API
- Create and access JSON objects online
- Optimize the performance of applications
- The importance of clean code and organized components
- The importance of planning and structuring the project
- Component reusability for efficiency
- A better understanding of animations using CSS and Spring

___
## Technologies Used

- ReactJs
- Javascript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Redux
- Reactstrap (React-Bootstrap) 
- Persist (Redux)
- Spring (React-Spring)

___
## Difficulties I encountered along with the solution

- **Difficulty** Finding a public API to use as a mock data for my app, as well as copyright for product images  <br />
**Solution:** I had to spend time creating and designing my mock data with an online JSON server; I also had to replace the pictures with random image placeholders.

- **Difficulty** Problem dealing with the dynamic data of my components  <br />
**Solution:** Solve it using React Redux

- **Difficulty** I don't have an online database to handle dynamic data  <br />
 **Solution:** Solve it using Persist Redux and save the data locally

- **Difficulty** The component would take too long to load and bad laggy experience  <br />
 **Solution:** Learned how to optimize the performance of the application
